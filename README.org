* decork

decork is a clone of corkscrew, a tool for tunneling ssh traffic over http proxies.  compared to the original corkscrew, it tries to be intelligent about =$http_proxy=. decork will happily parse =$http_proxy= and obtain there the proxy and the authentication details.  but you can still override it with =--proxy= and =--auth=.

decork is handy if you are in a dynamic environment where the proxy is constantly changing, and/or =$http_proxy= is managed by something else.

** usage

update the =ProxyCommand= in your ssh config, like this:

#+begin_src conf
  Host github.com
       HostName ssh.github.com
       Port 443
       User git
       ProxyCommand decork %h:%p --auth ~/.ssh/proxy_auth
#+end_src

note: =%h= is the destination host, and =%p= the destination port. in this case, =ssh.github.com= and =443=.

** installation

install the rust toolchain, clone this repo, and run

#+begin_src bash
  cargo install --path .
#+end_src
